# Using CSC services at UH

This repository contains instructions for setting up and running courses at the University of Helsinki that use services provided by [CSC â€“ IT Centre for Science](https://www.csc.fi/).

A typical scenario might involve using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.csc.fi/home) for teaching materials and interactive programming using the [cloud computing infrastructure at CSC](https://notebooks.csc.fi).

## Prerequisites

### Permissions

*For CSC*

- [ ] Register for [a CSC account](https://sui.csc.fi/web/guest/register) via the Scientist's User Interface (SUI). Use your HAKA Federation login (that is, your university login).
- [ ] Create a new CSC project in SUI. 
- [ ] Apply for [cPouta cloud service access](https://research.csc.fi/pouta-application) using the Scientist's User Interface.
- [ ] Apply for group administrator rights for Pouta Notebooks by e-mailing *servicedesk (at) csc.fi*. Write that you are running a course on Pouta Notebooks and require group administrator rights. Mention your CSC username, which you can find under *My Account* on SUI.
- [ ] Apply for access to the Rahti platform if you plan to set up a custom environment for the course with specific libraries (e.g. spaCy and NLTK for natural language processing in Python) by e-mailing *servicedesk (at) csc.fi). Mention your CSC username, which you can find under *My Account* on SUI and your CSC project ID.

*For GitHub*

- [ ] Sign up for a GitHub account and apply for an [educational discount](https://help.github.com/en/articles/applying-for-an-educator-or-researcher-discount). This discount allows you to create unlimited private repositories.
- [ ] Sign up for [GitHub classroom](http://cscfi.github.io/pebbles/group_owners_guide.html). This is where you will set up individual and group assignments for students.
